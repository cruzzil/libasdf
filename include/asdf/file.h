 * .. _int getters:
 *
 * Integer getters
 * ---------------
 *
 * The following functions are the type checkers and getters for integer types.
 *
 * When libasdf detects an integer scalar it assigns to it the smallest C
 * integer type that can hold that value.  For example the number ``42`` is
 * typed as `ASDF_VALUE_UINT8`.
 *
 * However, integer up-casting to larger integer types is allowed
 * Downcasting that would cause an overflow is not allowed.  For example ``42``
 * can be cast to an ``int16``, but ``-42`` cannot be cast to a ``uint16``.
 *
 * .. note::
 *
 *   In practice, unless you know some schema expects a small integer for a
 *   value, you will mostly just want to use `asdf_get_int64`.
 *
 * With the ``asdf_get_(uint)N`` getters the `asdf_value_err_t` return value
 * may also be `ASDF_VALUE_ERR_OVERFLOW` if the value is an integer that is too
 * large to represent in the requested type.
 *
 * Big integers (greater than ``UINT64_MAX`` or less than ``INT64_MIN``) are
 * not supported--in fact the ASDF Standard expressly
 * `forbids <ASDF Numeric Literals>`_ writing them to ASDF files.  Nevertheless
 * it could be supported in the future if the need arises.  In fact,
 * technically the ASDF Standard disallows integers greater than ``INT64_MAX``
 * but here we do allow unsigned integers up to ``UINT64_MAX``.

 * at a given :ref:`yaml-pointer` path.  Every setter takes the `asdf_file_t *`
 * as its first argument, the path as its second, and the value to write as the
 * remaining argument(s).
 *
 * Any intermediate mappings named in the path that do not yet exist are
 * created automatically, and an existing value already at the path is
 * replaced.  Each function returns `ASDF_VALUE_OK` on success or an
 * `asdf_value_err_t` error code.
 *
 * `asdf_set_value` inserts a pre-built generic `asdf_value_t *`;
 * `asdf_set_string` takes an explicit byte length while `asdf_set_string0`
 * expects a NUL-terminated string; `asdf_set_null` takes no value argument.
 * The remaining scalar variants accept the corresponding C type directly
 *
 * For extension types, each register extension has a corresponding
 * ``asdf_set_<extension>``, mirroring the ``asdf_get_<extension>`` functions
 * described in :ref:`file-extension-getters`.  For example, `asdf_set_ndarray`
 * can be used to assign an `asdf_ndarray_t *` to a path in YAML tree.
 *
 * See :ref:`writing` for a narrative guide.
