/**
 * .. _asdf/log.h:
 *
 * Logging configuration and the logging API.
 *
 * libasdf emits diagnostic log messages associated with each open file.  Every
 * `asdf_file_t` carries a logging configuration (an `asdf_log_cfg_t`), which can
 * be provided up front through the ``log`` field of `asdf_config_t` when opening
 * a file with `asdf_open_ex`.  Messages at or above the configured
 * `asdf_log_level_t` are written to the configured stream (``stderr`` by
 * default), optionally colorized and with a configurable set of prefix fields.
 *
 * If no level is set explicitly the default is taken from the ``ASDF_LOG_LEVEL``
 * environment variable (one of ``NONE``, ``TRACE``, ``DEBUG``, ``INFO``,
 * ``WARN``, ``ERROR``, or ``FATAL``, case-insensitive), falling back to
 * ``WARN``.
 *
 * The library's own internal log statements are compiled in only when libasdf
 * is built with logging enabled (the default; disable with ``-DENABLE_LOG=NO``
 * under CMake or ``--disable-logging`` under the Autotools build).  The public
 * `asdf_file_log` function and `ASDF_LOG` macro are provided for extension
 * authors who wish to emit messages through the same configuration; see
 * :ref:`extensions`.
